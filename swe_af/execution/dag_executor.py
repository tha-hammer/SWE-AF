    Instead of level barriers (where ALL issues in a level must complete before
    the next level starts), this uses an event-driven loop driven by the
    dependency graph:

    1. Compute ready set: issues with all dependencies resolved
    2. Launch ready issues (bounded by semaphore)
    3. Wait for ANY task to complete (FIRST_COMPLETED)
    4. On completion: mark done, check if merge wave should fire
    5. On failure: skip downstream, optionally trigger replanner
    6. Repeat until all issues are done/skipped/failed

    Merge waves fire when:
      - A batch of completions accumulates (default 3), OR
      - A natural sync point is reached (nothing in-flight, nothing ready), OR
      - A ready issue depends on a pending-merge issue (needs merged code)

    Levels are still computed for planning/visualization/checkpoint but no
    longer used as execution barriers.

    Args:
        plan_result: Output of the planning pipeline (PlanResult dict).
        repo_path: Path to the target repository.
        execute_fn: Optional async callable ``(issue: dict, dag_state: DAGState) -> IssueResult``.

        note_fn: Optional callback for observability.
        call_fn: Optional ``app.call`` for invoking reasoners.
        node_id: Agent node_id for constructing call targets.
        git_config: Optional git configuration from ``run_git_init``.
        resume: If True, attempt to load a checkpoint and skip completed work.
