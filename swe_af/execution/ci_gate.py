"""Deterministic helpers for the post-PR CI gate.

The CI gate watches GitHub Actions checks on a PR after SWE-AF pushes its
work, using the ``gh`` CLI. Polling and log retrieval live here so they can
be unit-tested without a GitHub remote or an LLM in the loop.

PRs are opened ready for review (no draft phase). ``mark_pr_ready`` remains
in this module as a backwards-compatible no-op for callers that still
invoke it, but the build pipeline no longer calls it.
